            PollNeumo is a modern, minimalistic voting system built with a soft
            neumorphism UI design. It allows users to vote for their favorite
            programming language in a visually engaging and user-friendly
            interface. This project combines elegant UI design with simple
            interactive logic to display live vote results as percentages with
            smooth progress bars.

            The goal of this project is to explore the combination of React
            interactivity and neumorphism design â€” blending functionality with
            aesthetic. It's part of a UI/UX-driven journey in front-end
            development.
